# Quizzical

This is a React native conversion of my previous project [Quizzical](https://github.com/jdegand/scrimba-quizzical).  

## Thoughts

- Styling problem - width of the question determines width of the question container - only noticeable when question length is short
- IOS changes not complete - buttons need styling - and gap doesn't seem to be applied - depends on version of ios
- Untouched questions don't get a gray background
- Not ideal to have blue text with a green or red background - so changed text to white - also red / green are not the exact colors used in the figma file
